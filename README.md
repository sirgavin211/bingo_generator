# Bingo Bulk

A minimal bingo generator, capable of generating over hundreds of unique bingo boards <br>
given a set of text. Most bingo generators have little to no customization and can <br>
rarely generate many boards at once.

### Installation and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sirgavin211/bingo_generator.git
cd bingo_generator
npm run dev
```

### How to use BingoBulk

Paste in a set of at least 25 words each seperated by a character. Type that character <br>
into the seperator input box. Click generate board and adjust colors accordingly. <br>
When ready to print, adjust the amount of boards wanted to be printed and then <br>
click Print Board.
